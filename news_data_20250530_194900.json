This is more than the combined 2023 annual greenhouse gases emitted by Costa Rica and Estonia, yet there is no obligation for states to report military emissions to the UN climate body.Over 99% of the almost 1.89m tCO2e estimated to have been generated between the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack and the temporary ceasefire in January 2025 is attributed to Israel's aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza.Almost 30% of greenhouse gases generated in that period came from the US sending 50,000 tonnes of weapons and other military supplies to Israel, mostly on cargo planes and ships from stockpiles in Europe. Another 20% is attributed to Israeli aircraft reconnaissance and bombing missions, tanks and fuel from other military vehicles, as well as CO2 generated by manufacturing and exploding the bombs and artillery.Solar had generated as much as a quarter of Gaza's electricity, representing one of the world's highest shares, but most panels, and the territory's only power plant, have been damaged or destroyed. Gaza's limited access to electricity now mostly relies on diesel-guzzling generators that emitted just over 130,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, or 7% of the total conflict emissions.More than 40% of the total emissions were generated by the estimated 70,000 aid trucks Israel allowed into the Gaza Strip - which the UN has condemned as grossly insufficient to meet the basic humanitarian needs of 2.2m displaced and starving Palestinians.

Panicked civilians fled the scene, most without the food they came for; dozens of people were injured, and at least one died.UK news | The housing ombudsman has warned that \"simmering anger at poor housing conditions risks becoming social disquiet\", as his office records a 474% increase in complaints.

The ruling, which the White House is said to be appealing, would blow a hole in Trump's strategy to use steep tariffs to wring concessions from trading partners.Ukraine | Ukraine and Germany have agreed to future military cooperation in which Berlin will help finance long-range weapons production on Ukrainian soil.

Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1 percent in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3 percent in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.6 percent. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed. The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court .

Critics argue the changes could leave some conscripts stuck at the rank of private first class (PFC) for most of their 18- to 21-month mandatory military service, costing them up to 4 million won ($2,898) in lost wages. The ministry defends the move as necessary to strengthen combat readiness in response to growing security threats. The policy's impact goes beyond financial losses, raising concerns about morale, fairness and the principle of conscription in a draft-reliant nation. It risks fueling discontent among the young men forced to serve, eroding public trust in the military and weakening efforts to sustain a motivated, capable force. Recently disseminated guidelines to military units notably eliminate the previous two-month ceiling on delayed promotions. Under this new framework, a soldier failing to satisfy promotion benchmarks could conceivably remain at the rank of PFC for a period of up to 15 months, with subsequent promotions to corporal occurring only on the f",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the most sweeping of President Donald Trump's tariffs on Thursday, a day after a trade court had ruled Trump had exceeded his authority in imposing the duties and ordered an immediate block on them. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said it was pausing the lower court's ruling to consider the government's appeal, and ordered the plaintiffs in the cases to respond by June 5 and the administration by June 9. Wednesday's surprise ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade had threatened to kill or at least delay the imposition of Trump's so-called Liberation Day tariffs on imports from most U.S. trading partners and additional tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China. The latter was related to his accusation that the three countries were facilitating the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. The trade court's three-judge panel ruled that the Constitution gave Congress, not the president, the power to levy taxes and tariffs, and that the president had exceeded his authority by invoking the International Emergen",

The Atlas looked to focus on ensuring driving comfort to appeal more to customers seeking a family vehicle. Unlike other common German vehicles, the Atlas exuded softer driving performance during drives both in a highway and a city. The SUV was equipped with a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline engine. Its maximum output reaches 273 horsepower. However, it felt like this was not sufficient for the huge SUV, with a length reaching 5,095 millimeters, the longest among vehicles available for sale in the same segment here.

    "summary": "As Disney and Pixar prepare to release their new animated film \"Elio\" in Korea on July 18, one of the most visually striking elements -- glittering sands and vast oceans -- was crafted by a Korean artist behind the scenes. Lee Jae-joon, a 40-year-old effect technical director who joined Pixar in December 2021, helped bring the film's complex natural phenomena to life. Effect technical directors are responsible for simulating natural and physical effects, such as water, fire, dust and wind, using computer graphics. Their work plays a crucial role in enhancing realism and immersion in animation, film and games. Lee has contributed to several major Pixar productions, including \"Elemental,\" a hit with Korean audiences, and \"Inside Out 2,\" which recently became the highest-grossing animated film of all time. Yet when Lee spoke with the Hankook Ilbo at Pixar's headquarters in Emeryville, California, on May 6, he said \"Elio\" is particularly meaningful to him. \"I saw myself in Elio's loneliness,\" Lee said. \"He wants to escape Earth, and that reminded me of how I felt",

The plan, which says it is guaranteed by U.S. President Donald Trump and mediators Egypt and Qatar, includes sending aid to Gaza as soon as Hamas signs off on the ceasefire agreement. The plan stipulates that Hamas will release the last 30 hostages once a permanent ceasefire is in place. The White House said on Thursday that Israel has agreed to the U.S. ceasefire proposal. The Palestinian militant group Hamas told Reuters it was reviewing the plan and will respond on Friday or Saturday. Deep differences between Hamas and Israel have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire that broke down in March. Israel has insisted that Hamas disarm completely and be dismantled as a military and governing force and that all 58 hostages still held in Gaza must be returned before it will agree to end the war.

    "summary": "UNITED NATIONS -- The United States and 10 allies on Thursday said the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea flagrantly violates U.N. sanctions and has helped Moscow increase its missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. They made the accusations in their first report since joining forces to monitor sanctions against North Korea after Russia vetoed a resolution in March 2024 to continue the monitoring by a U.N. Security Council panel of experts. It had been issuing reports of Pyongyang's sanctions violations since 2010. The 29-page report produced by the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team -- comprised of the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and the United Kingdom -- said the evidence it gathered demonstrates that North Korea and Russia have engaged in \"myriad unlawful activities\" explicitly prohibited by U.N. sanctions resolutions. It said North Korea has transferred arms and related materiel by sea, air and rail, including artillery, ballistic missiles and combat vehicles, for Russia's use in the war i",

    "summary": "The pet insurance market is hopeful that the new government will help reverse the slower-than-expected growth in subscription rate despite a sharp increase in the number of Koreans living with companion animals. Lee Jae-myung, the presidential frontrunner from the liberal Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), and Kim Moon-soo, Lee's opponent from the conservative People Power Party (PPP), all have pledged to standardize the costs of veterinary care. The costs vary greatly and thus place a significant financial burden on an estimated 15 million Koreans who own pets. A government-led cost policy is expected to improve transparency around premiums, coverage and other cost-related issues in pet insurance, as well as boost the number of subscribers, according to industry officials. They noted that a lack of consistency was a major reason why only a small percentage of pet owners opt for veterinary insurance. Since companion animals are not covered by national health insurance, owners must bear 100 percent of the medical costs. While private pet insurance is an option, uptake remains low, and veter",
